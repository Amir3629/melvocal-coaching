# Setup Complete âœ…

## What's Been Done

Your Vocal Coaching website has been completely set up for local development. The following improvements were made:

1. **Fixed Image Path Handling**: Images now display correctly in both development and production environments.

2. **Added Placeholder System**: Missing images are replaced with descriptive placeholders during development.

3. **Enhanced Booking Forms**: Removed the calendar option and fixed the confirmation step.

4. **Improved Legal Document Display**: Better styling and scrolling for legal documents.

5. **Created Comprehensive Setup**: A single command now sets up everything needed for development.

6. **Added Documentation**: Added README.md and FIXES-SUMMARY.md with detailed instructions.

## Running the Website

You can now run the website locally with:

```bash
npm run setup
```

Or:

```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the website locally at http://localhost:3000

2. Replace placeholder images with real content by adding files to:
   - `public/images/gallery/`
   - `public/images/backgrounds/` 
   - `public/images/services/`

3. Review all pages and functionality to ensure everything works as expected

4. When ready, deploy to GitHub Pages with:
   ```
   npm run deploy
   ```
